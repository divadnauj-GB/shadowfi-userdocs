Welcome to ShadowFI's documentation!
====================================

SHADOWFI is an emulation-based fault injection framework for fault 
chareacterization and reliability assesemnt of hardware designs. 
SHADOWFI leverages the acceleration capabilities of hiperscale infrastructures 
providing support for executing long fault injection 
tasks in both High Performance Computing (HPC) and FPGA hiperscaler systems.

SHADOWFI implements fault instrumentation by inserting saboteur circuits 
directly on syntesizable HDL designs. This instrumentation is applied 
automatically based on user configurations, providing flexibility regarding 
the target components or hardware structures subject of evaluation.
